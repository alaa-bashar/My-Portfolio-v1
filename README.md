My first portfolio

## Responsive portfolio using HTML & CSS

Mastering means a lot of practice,

So after finishing these 3 courses from LinkedIn Learning:
1. Succeeding in Web Development: Full Stack and Front End.
2. HTML essential training.
3. CSS essential training.
(Links are in the comments)

I needed to practice more and I found it very interesting to make a portfolio only by using pure HTML and CSS with an attractive design and make it responsive to different screen sizes as much as possible.
