Mastering means a lot of practice,

So after finishing these 3 courses from LinkedIn Learning:
1. Succeeding in Web Development: Full Stack and Front End. [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/5bd3e9a1fb0eaecfab7bc6480d7e3f5d7f00ad5f298a5d3ccdc9bfd6e58c091d?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_certifications_details%3BXHigXYf9ReCeuCn35GX8Aw%3D%3D)
2. HTML essential training. [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/c76d59d59093c4ee49e69623fde498f3fb500561c92365ad3c0910c63ec8eea8?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_certifications_details%3BXHigXYf9ReCeuCn35GX8Aw%3D%3D)
3. CSS essential training. [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/194b3a36f75ee26bbd9db53f7da3796c910a195b294174421b599fbd271b8fa1?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_certifications_details%3BXHigXYf9ReCeuCn35GX8Aw%3D%3D)

I needed to practice more and I found it very interesting to make a portfolio only by using pure HTML and CSS with an attractive design and make it responsive to different screen sizes as much as possible.
