Mastering means a lot of practice,

So after finishing these 3 courses from LinkedIn Learning:
1. Succeeding in Web Development: Full Stack and Front End. [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/5bd3e9a1fb0eaecfab7bc6480d7e3f5d7f00ad5f298a5d3ccdc9bfd6e58c091d?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_certifications_details%3BXHigXYf9ReCeuCn35GX8Aw%3D%3D)

I needed to practice more and I found it very interesting to make a portfolio only by using pure HTML and CSS with an attractive design and make it responsive to different screen sizes as much as possible.
